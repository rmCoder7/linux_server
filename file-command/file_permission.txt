file symbol type
===============

there are 7 types of file in Linux : 

- = regular file  (usually use in cretae file, "touch file")

d = directory (folde that usally use, command is "mkdir")

l = link 

c = Device file ( Represents devices that handle data character by character, such as terminals or serial ports,
 /dev/input/mouse2 , we are using mouse , hence it create a mouse for that)


s = socket file  (It enables processes to exchange data, either on the same machine or between different 
machines over a network., find it under in /run)

p = Named pipe and FIFO (it is FIRST IN FIRST OUT, Ccommand mkfifo)

b = block device (A Block Device in Linux represents hardware devices that handle data as
 fixed-sized blocks, typically for storage purposes, find it in /dev /sda1 )


*** if we want to find any file types, "find / -type s"
*** if want to see any partitoin in disk then see, "fdisk" 
*** if want to see all type of folder along with "ls -al"
*** if we want to start with ,cd /, then we call it "Absoulte path". like cd /var/log. And if we jump directly
     this path we called it relative path. like "cd log"
*** Mentioned "pwd: is give you right path you are in.
